# language-coding
This Project aims to contains all types of programs of all languages.

## Topics
## Basic Syntax
Contains the basic syntax of the programming language printing Hello World! program.

## Variable
A variable in simple terms is a storage place which has some memory allocated to it. Basically, a variable used to store some form of data. Different types of variables require different amounts of memory, and have some specific set of operations which can be applied on them.

## Function
A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. Funtion is of two types:-
- Built-in function
- User defined function

## Class and Object
Class is an abstract data type and object is it's runtime entity. Class is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.	


## Data Structure
### Array
An array is collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

### Linked List
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. Linked List uses random variable allocation.

### Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). In Stack the element which is added at last is removed first.

### Queue
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In Queue the element which is added first is removed first.

### Tree
A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
